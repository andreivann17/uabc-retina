"""
Database configuration and helper utilities.

This module centralizes the logic for connecting to the MySQL database.
Using a connection pool improves performance by re‑using existing
connections instead of creating new ones on every request. The
connection parameters are read from environment variables to avoid
hard‑coding secrets in the source code. When the application starts,
``init_pool`` should be called to set up the pool; subsequent calls
to ``get_connection`` will return a connection from the pool. If
``init_pool`` has not been called the first call to ``get_connection``
will automatically initialize the pool with sane defaults.
